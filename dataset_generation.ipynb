    "## Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Starting Simple\n",
    "Start w/ simple dataset of permutations of X is type A(and B) for ALL pokemon. Create a train/val/test set of questions (and permutations) like: 'what type is Pokemon P?\" and include only train pokemon in the dataset. Be sure to test the accuracy of the model first (maybe also have a Phi-3 LLM compare the generations to the ground truth? Or maybe just make outlines generate the type?\n",
    "\n",
    "Couple of params you can change here already:\n",
    "- number of permutations of X is type A.\n",
    "- number of permutations of what type is Pokemon P (basically how many ways do we word the question)\n",
    "- lora rank and alpha (maybe use the continuous fine-tuning NB/params)\n",
    "- try to achieve grokking w/ SUPER OVERFITTING and a massive ratio of questions to facts (maybe try adding grokfast to this? https://github.com/ironjr/grokfast)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Try more facts (such as pokemon stats, ability, etc)\n",
    "Try grouping stuff (pokemons A,B,C, and D have type X, but Pokemon A is also type B, etc), also group by stats (every pokemon with 100 speed is a,b,c, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reverse training nurses the reversal curse (what pokemon have 100 speed? What pokemon are water and dragon type?)\n",
    "\n",
    "OOOH! Reveral curse: bulbasaur evolves into ivysaur, ivysaur evolves into venusaur. What pokemon does bulbasaur evolve into? (one way) What pokemon evolves into ivysaur? (reverse)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, what happens if I add, like, interference (i.e. slight typos, random capitalization for pokemon, random spaces)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting question (reversal curse?) What Pokemon is the same type as Marshtom?"
